# Elm Maze game with Emacs and Vim key bindings

![Image of screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xyc0562/editor-maze/master/img/screenshot.png)

This game is inspired by ["HJKL"](https://github.com/vim-scripts/HJKL) by Bi Ran, a Vimscript maze game for beginners to
familiarize themselves with Vim's direction keys.

The game further allows switching between Vim and Emacs key bindings and setting of Maze size.
To play, a keyboard is needed (obviously). As a multiplayer game, you can compete with others as well!
